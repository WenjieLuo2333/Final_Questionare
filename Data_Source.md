We get the data from [Kaggle TGS challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge).

4000 imgages are labeled by Kaggle. And 16000 without labels used as test set.

These images are seizmic images from different depth and these are all 101x101 BW images.

Images are clean and of good qiality. Because all images are labeled exactly without noise. And it's ok to get a satisfying result only with images. Depth information is used to divide the dataset.
